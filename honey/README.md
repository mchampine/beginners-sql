# honey

This directory is a leiningen project that contains the [honeysql](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql) version of examples for [A Beginner's Guide to SQL](https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2016/07/07/a-beginners-guide-to-sql/)

db/database.db is a SQLite Database populated with all the data needed to run the example queries. You can use it as-is, or create your own by executing the create-table calls, then run the insert-multi! calls to populate it.

## Usage

Clone the repo and try out the queries in [src/honey/src/core.clj](https://github.com/mchampine/beginners-sql/blob/master/honey/src/honey/core.clj)
